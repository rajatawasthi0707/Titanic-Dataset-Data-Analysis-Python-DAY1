# Titanic Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Analysis project! In this project, I analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover insights and visualize the data through various techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the [Titanic Dataset](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/stuff/titanic.csv). You can download the dataset from the provided link.

## Data Analysis Questions

1. **What is the overall survival rate of the passengers?**
   - This analysis calculates the proportion of passengers who survived the Titanic disaster.

2. **How does the survival rate vary by passenger class (Pclass)?**
   - This question examines how survival rates differ across the different passenger classes.

3. **What is the distribution of ages among the passengers?**
   - This analysis explores the age distribution of passengers on the Titanic.

4. **How does the survival rate vary between male and female passengers?**
   - This question investigates survival rates across gender.

5. **What is the correlation between age and survival rate?**
   - This analysis looks into the relationship between a passenger's age and their likelihood of survival.

6. **What is the survival rate for families (siblings/spouses and parents/children)?**
   - This question examines how survival rates differ for passengers traveling with family members.

7. **What is the average fare paid by passengers, and how does it vary by class and survival status?**
   - This analysis explores the average fare paid by passengers and how it varies based on class and survival status.

## Data Visualization Questions

1. **Create a bar plot showing the number of passengers in each class (Pclass).**
   - This visualization displays the distribution of passengers across different classes.

2. **Create a pie chart showing the proportion of passengers who survived vs. those who did not.**
   - This pie chart visualizes the survival rate of passengers compared to those who did not survive.

3. **Create a histogram showing the age distribution of the passengers.**
   - This histogram illustrates the distribution of passengers' ages.

4. **Create a bar plot comparing the survival rates of male and female passengers.**
   - This bar plot compares survival rates between male and female passengers.

5. **Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between age and fare paid.**
   - This scatter plot reveals any correlation between passengers' ages and the fares they paid.

6. **Create a box plot showing the distribution of fares across different passenger classes.**
   - This box plot visualizes how fare distributions vary across different passenger classes.

7. **Create a heatmap to show the correlation between different numerical features in the dataset.**
   - This heatmap provides a visual representation of the correlations between numerical features.
